        At the end of each season, Adelante participants at the junior or senior level who have at least one year of full-time participation in our program can apply to be an Ambassador for the following season. 
        Ambassadors must agree to the Leadership Code of Conduct Agreement outlined in this manual, as well as participate in a Summer Ambassador’s Retreat. If at any time an Ambassador is failing to live up to his or her agreement, 
        the Executive Director and Ambassadors Program Coordinator may together revoke that student’s standing as Ambassador.
