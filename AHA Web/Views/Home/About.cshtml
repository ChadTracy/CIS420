        <h2>Our History and Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our Louisville community has seen a 122% increase in the Hispanic/Latino population
            over the last decade, and its numbers continue to grow. This diverse Hispanic population
            contributes to an ever evolving, multi-cultural Louisville, significantly impacting our
            future as a community. As the number of Hispanics entering the workforce and attending
            public schools grows, we must consider the unique challenges the Hispanic population is facing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adelante Hispanic Achievers was created to address such challenges in our city by
            empowering Louisville’s Hispanic youth and helping them succeed in four critical area
            of development: personal, social, cultural, and educational. Adelante was founded in
            January 2004 by former JCPS school board chair Stephen Imhoff and a core of community
            leaders who shared the belief that with support and resources, Louisville’s Hispanic
            students and their families can have a bright future. Adelante’s mission is to inspire
            Hispanic/Latino youth and families to achieve their dreams and contribute as creative
            and educated world citizens.
