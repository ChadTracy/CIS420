        <h2>Our History and Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our Louisville community has seen a 122% increase in the Hispanic/Latino population
            over the last decade, and its numbers continue to grow. This diverse Hispanic population
            contributes to an ever evolving, multi-cultural Louisville, significantly impacting our
            future as a community. As the number of Hispanics entering the workforce and attending
            public schools grows, we must consider the unique challenges the Hispanic population is facing.

            Adelante Hispanic Achievers was created to address such challenges in our city by
            empowering Louisville’s Hispanic youth and helping them succeed in four critical area
            of development: personal, social, cultural, and educational. Adelante was founded in
            January 2004 by former JCPS school board chair Stephen Imhoff and a core of community
            leaders who shared the belief that with support and resources, Louisville’s Hispanic
            students and their families can have a bright future. Adelante’s mission is to inspire
            Hispanic/Latino youth and families to achieve their dreams and contribute as creative
            and educated world citizens.
