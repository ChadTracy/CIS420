    The enrollment cap for this program is 65 students. Spots will be given first to returning students who submitted an Intent-to-Return form the previous year; new
    students will fill the remaining spots, with special consideration given to students who have siblings in the program. New students must enter the program in middle
    school by interviewing with staff in August, attending Orientation and Registration in September with their parents, and committing to regular attendance and good
    behavior. Adelante may accept new students throughout the year on an individual basis and with the consensus of the staff.
